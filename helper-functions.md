# Helper Functions
ModTools is the official helper object for creating mods. It is built-in to the Steam version of the game, and comes with a variety of functions to help with modding.

Helper functions are part of the ModTools object. Currently a list of helper functions are available on the official [modding documentation](https://florianvanstrien.nl/TheFinalEarth2/modding.php#helpers)
