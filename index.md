# The Final Earth 2 - Unofficial Modding Guide

This is an unofficial modding guide put together to provide more documentation on the game's code, as well as some more tutorials not present on the [official modding guide](https://florianvanstrien.nl/TheFinalEarth2/modding.php). It is in no way complete, and any help would be greatly appreciated! If you would like to contribute, fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tfe2-modding/tfe2-modding.github.io) for this website and make a pull request, or simply create an issue or discussion page on the repository.

The goal is to eventually have tutorials and documentation alike, however right now all this page has is some very rough documentation. If you are looking for a specific data file, ckeck the [Data Files](DataFiles/).

Need a specific sprite from the game? You can extract it via the sprite browser in the [Tools](Tools/).

There is also a page full of [Proposed Features](ProposedFeatures.html).
