# Contributing

To contribute new information to this repository (and this is REALLY IMPORTANT), please edit the files in the `src` folder. Do NOT edit anything in the `out` folder as it will absolutely not save or transfer over. Once you've edited the files you want, create a pull request. If it provides good information, I will accept the pull request and run the build script on my computer to copy the pages over to the `out` folder, where they are then displayed on the website. If you do not create an `index.md` file inside of a folder, one will be created automatically containing a list of links to all the files inside that folder.
