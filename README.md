# Modding The Final Earth 2 - Unofficial Documentation

This is an unofficial modding guide put together to provide more documentation on the game's code, as well as some more tutorials not present on the [official modding guide](https://florianvanstrien.nl/TheFinalEarth2/modding.php). It is in no way complete, and any help would be greatly appreciated!

## Contributing

A few important things to note when contributing:

- This project does not use github's flavor of markdown. It uses the flavor of markdown provided by [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked), which is included in this project. The only addition this has over basic markdown syntax is that you can prefix an image with an extra `!` to tell the builder that it is a downloadable texture (for example, in the Getting Started tutorial when I provide my wacky house texture).
- DO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING IN THE `.github` FOLDER IF WORKING ON PAGES! Those files are responsible for building the final website from the markdown files, so unless you are changing something absolutely crucial about how the site functions, do not motify them!
- All the things that need done are in [TODO], but the most important right now is tutorials and documentation. If you know how to do something in the game that isn't discussed in this modding guide, make a tutorial or write some documentation! Literally anything helps right now. Submit a pull request and I may ask you to make some edits before accepting it.
